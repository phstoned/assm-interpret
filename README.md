# assm-interpret
mnemonic to binary
Simple java interpreter which can be used only in studying purposes

#how to use
index point of application is UI/Laucher.java
this starts UI for working with the program
you should insert listing.asm to program input and click `translate` it will give you binary code for u mnemonic code

#works the same as assembler does
mnemonics are translated to machine code (binary)

#before starting
I have excluded css file `mac_os.css`
You should change it to any css file you want, or just delete code which relates to loading css files
Java we'll use be default modena.css styles
I have deleted the file `mac_os.css` for avoiding wrong repo's language detection
be attentive before starting it
